Apache Nutch 2.x with Cassandra on Docker
=======================

This project contains 3 Docker containers running Apache Nutch 2.x configured with [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org) storage.

This is project is fully operational but its still experimental, any feedback, suggestions should be directed to dev@nutch.apache.org and contribution(s) will be highly appreciated! 

# Usage

1. Build the images and start the containers " NOTE: for Mac OS running boot2docker, Please read the Notes section Below ". 

```
# Build the images ( this will build the application )
./bin/build.sh

# Start all containers with data folders from scripts
./bin/start.sh

# stop all containers 
./bin/stop.sh

# restart containers 
./bin/restart.sh

```
2. Start Crawling with Nutch 2.X.
```
# Run the crawler, You can use docker exec command, or you can docker attach to the container and run the commands there, or use docker-enter if you are using Mac OS

docker exec NUTCH01 /opt/nutch/bin/crawl /opt/nutch/testUrls test_crawl 3
# OR

docker-enter NUTCH01
root@9ec43c388769:/# cd opt/nutch
root@9ec43c388769:/opt/nutch# ./bin/crawl
Usage: crawl <seedDir> <crawlID> [<solrUrl>] <numberOfRounds>
root@9ec43c388769:/opt/nutch# ./bin/crawl testUrls test_crawl 3


```
## Notes

Nutch 2.x Container name : NUTCH01

Cassandra Container name : CASS01

Cassandra installed with OpsCenter


## MAC OSx Notes
- you need to mount data folders to your VirtualMachine to be able to get persistent data every time you run this application.
- You might need to install docker-enter for easier access to the containers

```
mkdir ~/docker-data
mkdir ~/docker-data/cassandra
mkdir ~/docker-data/nutch

chmod -R 777  ~/docker-data/

VBoxManage sharedfolder add boot2docker-vm -name home -hostpath ~/

boot2docker up
boot2docker ssh

# mkdir /data
# mount -t vboxsf -o uid=1000,gid=50 data /data
# vi /etc/fstab
# data            /data           vboxsf   rw,nodev,relatime    0 0
# docker-enter
```
