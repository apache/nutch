      <title>Overview</title>
      <p>Nutch is open source web-search software.  It builds on <a
      href="ext:lucene">Lucene</a>, adding web-specifics, such as a
      crawler, a link-graph database, parsers for HTML and other
      document formats, etc.</p>

      <p>For more information about Nutch, please see the <a

      <title>Incubation Disclaimer</title>
      <p>
        The Nutch project is an effort undergoing incubation at the
        Apache Software Foundation (ASF). Incubation is required of
        all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates
        that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making
        process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
        successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not
        necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of
        the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be
        fully endorsed by the ASF.
