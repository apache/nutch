      <title>June 2005: Nutch graduates from Incubator</title>

      <p>Nutch has now graduated from the Apache incubator, and is now
      a Subproject of Lucene.</p>

      <section>
      <title>January 2005: Nutch Joins Apache Incubator</title>

      <p>Nutch is a two-year-old open source project, previously
        hosted at Sourceforge and backed by its own non-profit
        organization. The non-profit was founded in order to assign
        copyright, so that we could retain the right to change the
        license. We have now determined that the Apache license is the
        appropriate license for Nutch and no longer require the
        overhead of an independent non-profit organization. Nutch's
        board of directors and its developers were both polled and
        supported the move to the Apache foundation.</p>

      <title>September 2004: Creative Commons launches Nutch-based Search</title>

      free to re-use on certain terms a search refinement offered by
      no other company or organization.</p>

      <title>September 2004: Oregon State University switches to Nutch</title>

      <p>Oregon State University is converting its searching
      infrastructure from Googletm to the open source project
      Nutch. The effort to replace the Googletm will realize
      significant cost savings for Oregon State University, while
      promoting both the Nutch Search Engine and transparency in
      search engine use and management.</p>
