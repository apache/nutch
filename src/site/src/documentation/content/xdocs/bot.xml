<p> If you're reading this, chances are you've seen a Nutch-based
robot visiting your site while looking through your server logs.  Our
software obeys robots.txt files and robot META tags in HTML.  These
are the standard mechanisms for webmasters to tell web robots which
portions of a site a robot is welcome to access. </p>

<section><title>Sysadmins/robots.txt</title>

<p>We're a software project, not a service, so please understand that
a misbehaving crawler appearing with our Agent string is not run by
us.  Our software may be run by anyone.  However, we'd still like to
hear about any bad behavior.  If possible, please include the name of
the domain and some representative log entries.  We can be reached at
<a href="mailto:agent@nutch.org"> agent@nutch.org</a>.</p>

<p> Our software obeys the robots.txt exclusion standard, described at
<a href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#robotstxt">
http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/exclusion.html#robotstxt</a>.  Different
installations of the Nutch software may specify different agent names,
but all should respond to the agent name "Nutch".  Thus to ban all
Nutch-based crawlers from your site, place the following in your
robots.txt file:</p>

<blockquote>
  <pre>User-agent: Nutch<br/>Disallow: /</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>If you do not have permission to edit the
/robots.txt file on your  server, you can still tell robots not to
index your pages or follow  your links.  The standard mechanism for
this is the robots META tag,  as described at<a
 href="http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html">
http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user.html</a>. </p>
