  This JSP demonstrates basic authentication. When this JSP page is
  requested with no query parameters, then the user must enter the
  username as 'userx' and password as 'passx' when prompted for
  authentication. Apart from this there are a few other test cases,
  which can be used by passing a test case number as query parameter in
  the following manner: basic.jsp?case=1, basic.jsp?case=2, etc.
  The credentials for each test case can be easily figured out from the
  code below.
