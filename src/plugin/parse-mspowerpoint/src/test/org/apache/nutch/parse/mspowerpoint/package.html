		<h1>JUnit Testpackage for Microsoft &copy; PowerPoint document parsing 
			plugin.</h1>
		<p>The example ppt-files are located in the subdirectory 
			<code>src/plugins/parse-mspowerpoint/samples</code>. They are 
			copied by the ant-task to the directory 
			<code>src/plugins/parse-mspowerpoint/data</code> for testing. 
			Additionaly to the ppt-files, there could also be stored files with 
			the same name with postfix ".content" or ".title". If they exists, 
			the test classes are checking the extracted content against these 
			files.</p>
		<h3>Example</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>PowerPoint file to test: <code>test.ppt</code></li>
				<li>Reference file with content: 
					<code>test.ppt.content</code></li>
				<li> Reference file with title and properties: 
					<code>test.ppt.title</code></li>
			</ul>
