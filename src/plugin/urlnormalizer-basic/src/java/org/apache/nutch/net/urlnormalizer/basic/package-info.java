/**
 * URL normalizer performing basic normalizations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>remove default ports, e.g., port 80 for <code>http://</code> URLs</li>
 * <li>remove needless slashes and dot segments in the path component</li>
 * <li>remove anchors</li>
 * <li>use percent-encoding (only) where needed</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * E.g.,
 * <code>https://www.example.org/a/../b//./select%2Dlang.php?lang=espa√±ol#anchor</code>
 * is normalized to <code>https://www.example.org/b/select-lang.php?lang=espa%C3%B1ol</code>
 * 
 * Optional and configurable normalizations are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>convert Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) uniquely either to the
 * ASCII (Punycode) or Unicode representation, see property
 * <code>urlnormalizer.basic.host.idn</code></li>
 * <li>remove a trailing dot from host names, see property
 * <code>urlnormalizer.basic.host.trim-trailing-dot</code></li>
 * </ul>
