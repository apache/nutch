This plugin uses an unreleased version of PDFBox, obtained from SourceForce
CVS repository (HEAD revision as of Feb 3 2009), because the last released
version contains a bug related to document decryption (see NUTCH-643).

The libraries should be updated to a regular PDFBox release whenever that
becomes available.
