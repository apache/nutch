<p>Currently we're just a handful of developers working part-time.  At
this point Nutch is coded entirely in Java, however persistent data is
written in language-independent formats so that, if needed, modules
may be re-written in other languages (e.g., C++) as the project
progresses.</p>

<p>Nutch has not yet been tuned for quality.  There are ten or twenty
knobs that we can twiddle to adjust the ranking formula.  We are
developing software to do this tuning automatically, but the current
code just contains guesses.  With a little tuning we should be able to
get results that are competitive with those of major search
engines.</p>

<p>As of June, 2003, we have successfully built a 100 million page
demo system.  Unfortunately, we do not yet have enough hardware to
support a public demo.  Hopefully we will be able to add that in the
next few months.  Stay tuned.</p>
