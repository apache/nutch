<p>Nutch is a nascent effort to implement an open-source web search
engine.</p>

<p>Web search is a basic requirement for internet navigation, yet the
number of web search engines is decreasing. Today's oligopoly could
soon be a monopoly, with a single company controlling nearly all web
search for its commercial gain.  That would not be good for users of
the internet.</p>

<p>Nutch provides a transparent alternative to commercial web search
engines.  Only open source search results can be fully trusted to be
without bias.  (Or at least their bias is public.)  All existing major
search engines have proprietary ranking formulas, and will not explain
why a given page ranks as it does.  Additionally, some search engines
determine which sites to index based on payments, rather than on the
merits of the sites themselves.  Nutch, on the other hand, has nothing
to hide and no motive to bias its results or its crawler in any way
other than to try to give each user the best results possible.</p>

<p>Nutch aims to enable anyone to easily and cost-effectively deploy a
world-class web search engine.  This is a substantial challenge.  To
succeed, Nutch software must be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>fetch several billion pages per month</li>
  <li>maintain an index of these pages</li>
  <li>search that index up to 1000 times per second</li>
  <li>provide very high quality search results</li>
  <li>operate at minimal cost</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a challenging proposition.  If you believe in the merits of
this project, please help out, either as a <a
href="http://www.apache.org/dev/">developer</a> or with a <a
href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html">donation</a>
