<h3>Queries</h3>
To search with Nutch, just type in a few words.
<ul>
  <li>Results only include pages that contain <span
 style="font-style: italic;">all</span> of the query words.</li>
  <li>Use quotes around words that must occur adjacently, as a phrase,
e.g., <span style="font-weight: bold;">"New Zealand"</span>.</li>
  <li>Punctuation between words also triggers phrase matching.  So
searching for <span style="font-weight: bold;">http://www.apache.org/</span>
is the same as searching for <span style="font-weight: bold;">"http www
apache org"</span>.</li>
  <li>Searches are not case-sensitive, so searching for <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">NuTcH</span> is the same as searching for <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">nUtCh</span>.</li>
  <li>You can prohibit a term from resulting pages by putting a minus
before it, e.g., searching for <span style="font-weight: bold;">football
-nfl</span> will find pages that discuss football, but don't use the
word "nfl".</li>
  <li>That's it!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Results</h3>
Each matching page in the results has the following links:
<ul>
  <li>(<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">cached</span>) displays
the version of the page that Nutch downloaded.</li>
  <li>(<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">explain</span>) displays
an explanation of how this page scored.</li>
  <li>(<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">anchors</span>) shows the
list of incoming anchors indexed for this page.</li>
</ul>
