<h3>Why does the world need Nutch, when search engines are free?</h3>

<p>Search engines are free to use like television is free to watch,
but, like television programming, search results are subject to
manipulation by the interests that control them.  The only way one can
be certain that search results are unbiased is if the technology which
computes them is public.  Nutch seeks to make high-quality search
technology freely available.</p>

<h3>How can a non-profit afford to run a search engine?</h3>

<p>Nutch is primarily a software project, not a service.  Large scale
deployments of Nutch will probably be run by commerical interests
separate from Nutch, funded by advertising or somesuch.  If the Nutch
software is good enough, perhaps existing major search engines will
use it in place of their current closed source code.</p>

<p>The Nutch project itself may choose to host small-scale demo
system, so that folks can see that it really works.  This will require
only moderate funding.  The Nutch project may never host a full-scale
deployment for folks to use as their everyday search engine.  We'll
leave that to commercial ventures that can afford it.</p>

<h3>Will Nutch ever be as good as other search engines?</h3>

<p>We hope it will be better.  With developers and researchers from
around the world helping out, we hope to be able to surpass the
quality of what any single company can do.</p>

<h3>How can I stop Nutch from crawling my site?</h3>

<p>Please visit our <a href="bot.html">webmaster info page</a>.</p>

<h3>How can I make sure that Nutch crawls my site?</h3>

<p>Nutch uses the <a href="http://www.dmoz.org/">DMOZ Open
Directory</a> to bootstrap its crawling.  So the best way to get your
site crawled by Nutch is to make sure that it is listed in the Open
Directory.</p>

<h3>Will Nutch be a distributed, P2P-based search engine?</h3>

<p>We don't think it is presently possible to build a peer-to-peer
search engine that is competitive with existing search engines.  It
would just be too slow.  Returning results in less than a second is
important: it lets people rapidly reformulate their queries so that
they can more often find what they're looking for.  In short, a fast
search engine is a better search engine.  I don't think many people
would want to use a search engine that takes ten or more seconds to
return results.</p>

<p>That said, if someone wishes to start a sub-project of Nutch
exploring distributed searching, we'd love to host it.  We don't think
these techniques are likely to solve the hard problems Nutch needs to
solve, but we'd be happy to be proven wrong.</p>

<h3>Will Nutch use a distributed crawler, like <a
href="http://www.grub.org/">Grub</a>?</h3>

<p>Distributed crawling can save download bandwidth, but, in the long
run, the savings is not significant.  A successful search engine
requires more bandwidth to upload query result pages than its crawler
needs to download pages, so making the crawler use less bandwidth does
not reduce overall bandwidth requirements.  The dominant expense of
operating a search engine is not crawling, but searching.</p>

<h3>Won't open source just make it easier for sites to manipulate
rankings?</h3>

<p>Search engines work hard to construct ranking algorithms that are
immune to manipulation.  Search engine optimizers still manage to
reverse-engineer the ranking algorithms used by search engines, and
improve the ranking of their pages.  For example, many sites use link
farms to manipulate search engines' link-based ranking algorithms, and
search engines retaliate by improving their link-based algorithms to
neutralize the effect of link farms.</p>

<p>With an open-source search engine, this will still happen, just out
in the open.  This is analagous to encryption and virus protection
software.  In the long term, making such algorithms open source makes
them stronger, as more people can examine the source code to find
flaws and suggest improvements.  Thus we believe that an open source
search engine has the potential to better resist manipulation of its
rankings.</p>

<h3>When will Nutch search images, pdf files, etc.?</h3>

<p>Soon, we hope.</p>
