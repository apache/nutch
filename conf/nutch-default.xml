<property>
  <name>file.content.limit</name>
  <value>1048576</value>
  <description>The length limit for downloaded content using the file://
  protocol, in bytes. If this value is non-negative (>=0), content longer
  than it will be truncated; otherwise, no truncation at all. Do not
  confuse this setting with the http.content.limit setting.
  </description>
</property>
  
<property>
  <name>file.crawl.parent</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>The crawler is not restricted to the directories that you specified in the
    URLs file but it is jumping into the parent directories as well. For your own crawlings you can
    change this behavior (set to false) the way that only directories beneath the directories that you specify get
    crawled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>file.crawl.redirect_noncanonical</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>
    If true, protocol-file treats non-canonical file names as
    redirects and does not canonicalize file names internally. A file
    name containing symbolic links as path elements is then not
    resolved and &quot;fetched&quot; but recorded as redirect with the
    canonical name (all links on path are resolved) as redirect
    target.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>file.content.ignored</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>If true, no file content will be saved during fetch.
  And it is probably what we want to set most of time, since file:// URLs
  are meant to be local and we can always use them directly at parsing
  and indexing stages. Otherwise file contents will be saved.
  !! NOT IMPLEMENTED YET !!

<!-- HTTP properties -->

<property>
  <name>http.agent.name</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>HTTP 'User-Agent' request header. MUST NOT be empty - 
  please set this to a single word uniquely related to your organization.

  NOTE: You should also check other related properties:

    http.robots.agents
    http.agent.description
    http.agent.url
    http.agent.email
    http.agent.version

  and set their values appropriately.

  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.robots.agents</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>Any other agents, apart from 'http.agent.name', that the robots
  parser would look for in robots.txt. Multiple agents can be provided using 
  comma as a delimiter. eg. mybot,foo-spider,bar-crawler
  
  The ordering of agents does NOT matter and the robots parser would make 
  decision based on the agent which matches first to the robots rules.  
  Also, there is NO need to add a wildcard (ie. "*") to this string as the 
  robots parser would smartly take care of a no-match situation. 
    
  If no value is specified, by default HTTP agent (ie. 'http.agent.name') 
  would be used for user agent matching by the robots parser. 
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.robot.rules.allowlist</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>Comma separated list of hostnames or IP addresses to ignore 
  robot rules parsing for. Use with care and only if you are explicitly
  allowed by the site owner to ignore the site's robots.txt!
  Also keep in mind: ignoring the robots.txt rules means that no robots.txt
  file is requested which may cause the following side effects:
  (1) undesired content (duplicates, private pages, etc.) excluded via
      robotst.txt rules is crawled,
  (2) the Crawl-Delay directive is ignored and
  (3) no sitemaps are detected.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.robots.403.allow</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Some servers return HTTP status 403 (Forbidden) if
  /robots.txt doesn't exist. This should probably mean that we are
  allowed to crawl the site nonetheless. If this is set to false,
  then such sites will be treated as forbidden.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.robots.503.defer.visits</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Temporarily suspend fetching from a host if the
  robots.txt response is HTTP 503 or any other 5xx server error. See
  also http.robots.503.defer.visits.delay and

  <value>3</value>
  <description>Number of retries crawling a host if the robots.txt
  response is HTTP 5xx - see http.robots.503.defer.visits. After n
  retries the host queue is dropped for this segment/cycle.
  </description>
</property>

  the User-Agent header.  It appears in parenthesis after the agent name.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.agent.url</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>A URL to advertise in the User-Agent header.  This will 
   appear in parenthesis after the agent name. Custom dictates that this
   should be a URL of a page explaining the purpose and behavior of this
   crawler.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.agent.email</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>An email address to advertise in the HTTP 'From' request
   header and User-Agent header. A good practice is to mangle this
   address (e.g. 'info at example dot com') to avoid spamming.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.agent.version</name>
  <value>Nutch-1.19</value>

</property>

<property>
  <name>http.content.limit</name>
  <value>1048576</value>
  <description>The length limit for downloaded content using the http/https
  protocols, in bytes. If this value is non-negative (>=0), content longer
  than it will be truncated; otherwise, no truncation at all. Do not
  confuse this setting with the file.content.limit setting.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.time.limit</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>The time limit in seconds to fetch a single document.
  If this value is non-negative (>=0), the HTTP protocol implementation
  will stop reading from a socket after http.time.limit seconds have
  been spent for fetching this document.  The HTTP response is then
  marked as truncated.  The http.time.limit should be set to a longer
  time period than http.timeout, as it applies to the entire duration
  to fetch a document, not only the network timeout of a single I/O
  operation.  Note: supported only by protocol-okhttp.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.partial.truncated</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    If true the HTTP protocol implementation may store the content of
    partial fetches and mark the response as truncated instead of
    throwing an exception which will cause the fetch to fail.  This
    allows to use the data which has already been fetched, instead of
    retrying the fetch later.  Note: supported only by protocol-okhttp.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.tls.certificates.check</name>
  <value>false</value>

    If true invalid (e.g., self-signed or expired) certificates are
    rejected and the https connection is failed.  If false insecure
    TLS/SSL connections are allowed.  Note that this property is
    currently not supported by all http/https protocol plugins.

  <value>en-us,en-gb,en;q=0.7,*;q=0.3</value>
  <description>Value of the "Accept-Language" request header field.
  This allows selecting non-English language as default one to retrieve.
  It is a useful setting for search engines build for certain national group.
  To send requests without "Accept-Language" header field, thi  property must
  be configured to contain a space character because an empty property does
  not overwrite the default.

  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.enable.if.modified.since.header</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Whether Nutch sends an HTTP If-Modified-Since header. It reduces
  bandwidth when enabled by not downloading pages that respond with an HTTP
  Not-Modified header. URLs that are not downloaded are not passed through
  parse or indexing filters. If you regularly modify filters, you should force
  Nutch to also download unmodified pages by disabling this feature.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.enable.cookie.header</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>Whether Nutch sends an HTTP Cookie header. The cookie value
  is read from the CrawlDatum Cookie metadata field.

<property>
  <name>http.connection.pool.okhttp</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>
    (EXPERT) List of 3 integer values [M,N,T]: Instantiate
    protocol-okhttp with M connection pools of size N and a keep-alive
    time of T seconds.  The product M*N should approx. correspond to
    the number of crawled hosts in one fetcher task during the
    keep-alive time.  Because OkHttp's connection pool (v4.9.1) is not
    optimized for fast look-up of connections, the pool size N should
    not exceed 1000.  To allow for efficient pooling, multiple pools
    are instantiated and connections are distributed over the pools by
    target host name.  If the property is undefined or empty a single
    pool is used with OkHttp's default size and keep-alive time. For
    OkHttp 4.9.1 the default is equivalent to a configuration value
    &quot;1,5,300&quot; - one pool with 5 idle connections and 300
    sec. keep-alive time.  See also NUTCH-2896 and
    https://square.github.io/okhttp/3.x/okhttp/okhttp3/ConnectionPool.html

    as a comma-separated list of a single IP address, a CIDR notation,
    or one of the following pre-defined IP address types: localhost,
    loopback, sitelocal. The property http.filter.ipaddress.exclude
    can be used to block subranges in the included list of ranges.

  <value>1048576</value>
  <description>The length limit for downloaded content, in bytes.
  If this value is non-negative (>=0), content longer than it will be truncated;
  otherwise, no truncation at all.
  Caution: classical ftp RFCs never defines partial transfer and, in fact,
  some ftp servers out there do not handle client side forced close-down very
  well. Our implementation tries its best to handle such situations smoothly.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ftp.timeout</name>

</property>

<property>
  <name>ftp.server.timeout</name>
  <value>100000</value>
  <description>An estimation of ftp server idle time, in millisec.
  Typically it is 120000 millisec for many ftp servers out there.
  Better be conservative here. Together with ftp.timeout, it is used to
  decide if we need to delete (annihilate) current ftp.client instance and
  force to start another ftp.client instance anew. This is necessary because
  a fetcher thread may not be able to obtain next request from queue in time
  (due to idleness) before our ftp client times out or remote server
  disconnects. Used only when ftp.keep.connection is true (please see below).
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>ftp.keep.connection</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>Whether to keep ftp connection. Useful if crawling same host
  again and again. When set to true, it avoids connection, login and dir list
  parser setup for subsequent URLs. If it is set to true, however, you must
  make sure (roughly):
  (1) ftp.timeout is less than ftp.server.timeout
  (2) ftp.timeout is larger than (fetcher.threads.fetch * fetcher.server.delay)
  Otherwise there will be too many "delete client because idled too long"

<property>
  <name>db.score.link.external</name>
  <value>1.0</value>
  <description>The score factor for new pages added due to a link from
  another host relative to the referencing page's score. Scoring plugins

<property>
  <name>db.score.count.filtered</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>The score value passed to newly discovered pages is
  calculated as a fraction of the original page score divided by the
  number of outlinks. If this option is false, only the outlinks that passed
  URLFilters will count, if it's true then all outlinks will count.

</property>

<property>
  <name>db.max.outlinks.per.page</name>
  <value>100</value>
  <description>The maximum number of outlinks that we'll process for a page.
  If this value is nonnegative (>=0), at most db.max.outlinks.per.page outlinks
  will be processed for a page; otherwise, all outlinks will be processed.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>db.max.outlink.length</name>
  <value>4096</value>
  <description>
    The maximum length in characters accepted for outlinks before
    applying URL normalizers and filters.  If this value is
    nonnegative (>=0), only URLs with a length in characters less or
    equal than db.max.outlink.length are accepted and then passed to
    URL normalizers and filters. Doing the length check beforehand
    avoids that normalizers or filters hang up on overlong URLs.
    Note: this property is only used to check URLs found as outlinks
    and redirects, but not for injected URLs.

  per IP in the new version of the Generator.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>generate.update.crawldb</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>For highly-concurrent environments, where several
  generate/fetch/update cycles may overlap, setting this to true ensures
  that generate will create different fetchlists even without intervening
  updatedb-s, at the cost of running an additional job to update CrawlDB.
  If false, running generate twice without intervening updatedb will
  generate identical fetchlists. See also crawl.gen.delay which defines
  how long items already generated are blocked.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>generate.min.score</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>Select only entries with a score larger than
  generate.min.score.</description>
</property>

<property>

  also takes 'byDomain' or 'byIP'. 
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>crawl.gen.delay</name>
  <value>604800000</value>
  <description>
   This value, expressed in milliseconds, defines how long we should keep the lock on records 
   in CrawlDb that were just selected for fetching. If these records are not updated 
   in the meantime, the lock is canceled, i.e. they become eligible for selecting again.
   Default value of this is 7 days (604800000 ms). If generate.update.crawldb is false
   the property crawl.gen.delay has no effect.
  </description>
</property>

<!-- fetcher properties -->

<property>
  <name>fetcher.server.delay</name>
  <value>5.0</value>
  <description>The number of seconds the fetcher will delay between 
   successive requests to the same server. Note that this might get
   overridden by a Crawl-Delay from a robots.txt and is used ONLY if 
   fetcher.threads.per.queue is set to 1.
   </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.server.min.delay</name>
  <value>0.0</value>
  <description>The minimum number of seconds the fetcher will delay between 
  successive requests to the same server. This value is applicable ONLY
  if fetcher.threads.per.queue is greater than 1 (i.e. the host blocking
  is turned off).</description>
</property>

<property>
 <name>fetcher.max.crawl.delay</name>
 <value>30</value>
 <description>
 If the Crawl-Delay in robots.txt is set to greater than this value (in
 seconds) then the fetcher will skip this page, generating an error report.
 If set to -1 the fetcher will never skip such pages and will wait the
 amount of time retrieved from robots.txt Crawl-Delay, however long that
 might be.
 </description>
</property> 

<property>
 <name>fetcher.min.crawl.delay</name>
 <value>${fetcher.server.delay}</value>
 <description>
 Minimum Crawl-Delay (in seconds) accepted in robots.txt, even if the
 robots.txt specifies a shorter delay. By default the minimum Crawl-Delay
 is set to the value of `fetcher.server.delay` which guarantees that
 a value set in the robots.txt cannot make the crawler more aggressive
 than the default configuration.
 </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.fetch</name>
  <value>10</value>
  <description>The number of FetcherThreads the fetcher should use.
  This is also determines the maximum number of requests that are
  made at once (each FetcherThread handles one connection). The total
  number of threads running in distributed mode will be the number of
  fetcher threads * number of nodes as fetcher has one map task per node.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.start.delay</name>
  <value>10</value>
  <description>Delay in milliseconds between starting Fetcher threads
  to avoid that all threads simultaneously fetch the first pages and
  cause that DNS or other resources are temporarily exhausted.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.per.queue</name>
  <value>1</value>
  <description>This number is the maximum number of threads that
    should be allowed to access a queue at one time. Setting it to 
    a value > 1 will cause the Crawl-Delay value from robots.txt to
    be ignored and the value of fetcher.server.min.delay to be used
    as a delay between successive requests to the same server instead 
    of fetcher.server.delay.
   </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.queue.mode</name>
  <value>byHost</value>
  <description>Determines how to put URLs into queues. Default value
  is 'byHost', also takes 'byDomain' or 'byIP'. Crawl delays are
  implemented on the level of fetcher queues.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.log.exceptions.suppress.stack</name>
  <value>java.net.UnknownHostException,java.net.NoRouteToHostException</value>
  <description>Comma-separated list of exceptions not shown with full
  stack trace in logs of fetcher and HTTP protocol implementations.
  The logs may shrink in size significantly, e.g., when for a large
  unrestricted web crawl unknown hosts are logged shortly without full
  stack trace.  The full class name of the exception class (extending
  Throwable) including the package path must be specified.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.parse</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>If true, fetcher will parse content. Default is false, which means
  that a separate parsing step is required after fetching is finished.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.store.content</name>
  <value>true</value>
  <description>If true, fetcher will store content.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.signature</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>If true, fetcher will generate the signature for
  successfully fetched documents even if the content is not parsed by
  fetcher (see property fetcher.parse).  Default is false, which means
  that the signature is calculated when parsing either by the fetcher
  or during the parsing step.  Note that a non-parsing fetcher can
  only generate signatures based on the binary content and not on the
  textual content. An appropriate signature class should be chosen
  (see property db.signature.class).
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.timelimit.mins</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>This is the number of minutes allocated to the fetching.
  Once this value is reached, any remaining entry from the input URL list is skipped 
  and all active queues are emptied. The default value of -1 deactivates the time limit.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.max.exceptions.per.queue</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>The maximum number of protocol-level exceptions
  (e.g. timeouts) or HTTP status codes mapped to ProtocolStatus.EXCEPTION
  per host (or IP) queue. Once this value is reached, any remaining entries
  from this queue are purged, effectively stopping the fetching from this
  host/IP. The default value of -1 deactivates this limit.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.exceptions.per.queue.delay</name>
  <value>${fetcher.server.delay}</value>
  <description>Initial value (in seconds) of an additional dynamic
  delay slowing down fetches from a queue after an exception has
  occurred (see also fetcher.max.exceptions.per.queue). Starting with
  the initial value the delay doubles with every observed exception:

    delay = fetcher.exceptions.per.queue.delay * 2^num_exception_in_queue

  An initial value of 0.0 disables this exponential backoff mechanism.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.throughput.threshold.pages</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>The threshold of minimum pages per second. If the fetcher downloads less
  pages per second than the configured threshold, the fetcher stops, preventing slow queue's
  from stalling the throughput. This threshold must be an integer. This can be useful when
  fetcher.timelimit.mins is hard to determine. The default value of -1 disables this check.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.throughput.threshold.retries</name>
  <value>5</value>
  <description>The number of times the fetcher.throughput.threshold.pages is allowed to be exceeded.
  This settings prevents accidental slow downs from immediately killing the fetcher thread.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.throughput.threshold.check.after</name>
  <value>5</value>
  <description>The number of minutes after which the throughput check is enabled.</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.threads.timeout.divisor</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>(EXPERT)The thread time-out divisor to use. By default threads have a time-out
  value of mapreduce.task.timeout / 2. Increase this setting if the fetcher waits too
  long before killing hanged threads. Be careful, a too high setting (+8) will most likely kill the
  fetcher threads prematurely.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.queue.depth.multiplier</name>
  <value>50</value>
  <description>(EXPERT)The fetcher buffers the incoming URLs into queues based on the [host|domain|IP]
  (see param fetcher.queue.mode). The depth of the queue is the number of threads times the value of this parameter.
  A large value requires more memory but can improve the performance of the fetch when the order of the URLS in the fetch list
  is not optimal.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.follow.outlinks.depth</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>(EXPERT)When fetcher.parse is true and this value is greater than 0 the fetcher will extract outlinks
  and follow until the desired depth is reached. A value of 1 means all generated pages are fetched and their first degree
  outlinks are fetched and parsed too. Be careful, this feature is in itself agnostic of the state of the CrawlDB and does not
  know about already fetched pages. A setting larger than 2 will most likely fetch home pages twice in the same fetch cycle.
  It is highly recommended to set db.ignore.external.links to true to restrict the outlink follower to URLs within the same
  domain. When disabled (false) the feature is likely to follow duplicates even when depth=1.
  A value of -1 of 0 disables this feature.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.follow.outlinks.num.links</name>
  <value>4</value>
  <description>(EXPERT)The number of outlinks to follow when fetcher.follow.outlinks.depth is enabled. Be careful, this can multiply
  the total number of pages to fetch. This works with fetcher.follow.outlinks.depth.divisor, by default settings the followed outlinks
  at depth 1 is 8, not 4.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.follow.outlinks.depth.divisor</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>(EXPERT)The divisor of fetcher.follow.outlinks.num.links per fetcher.follow.outlinks.depth. This decreases the number
  of outlinks to follow by increasing depth. The formula used is: outlinks = floor(divisor / depth * num.links). This prevents
  exponential growth of the fetch list.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.follow.outlinks.ignore.external</name>
  <value>true</value>  
  <description>Whether to ignore or follow external links. Set db.ignore.external.links to false and this to true to store outlinks
  in the output but not follow them. If db.ignore.external.links is true this directive is ignored.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.bandwidth.target</name>
  <value>-1</value>  
  <description>Target bandwidth in kilobits per sec for each mapper instance. This is used to adjust the number of 
  fetching threads automatically (up to fetcher.maxNum.threads). A value of -1 deactivates the functionality, in which case
  the number of fetching threads is fixed (see fetcher.threads.fetch).</description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.maxNum.threads</name>
  <value>25</value>  
  <description>Max number of fetch threads allowed when using fetcher.bandwidth.target. Defaults to fetcher.threads.fetch if unspecified or
  set to a value lower than it. </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.bandwidth.target.check.everyNSecs</name>
  <value>30</value>  
  <description>(EXPERT) Value in seconds which determines how frequently we should reassess the optimal number of fetch threads when using
   fetcher.bandwidth.target. Defaults to 30 and must be at least 1.</description>
</property>

<property>

  <name>fetcher.store.robotstxt</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>If true (and fetcher.store.content is also true),
  fetcher will store the robots.txt response content and status for
  debugging or archival purposes. The robots.txt is added to the
  content/ folder of the fetched segment.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
	<name>fetcher.publisher</name>
	<value>false</value>
	<description>Set this value to true if you want to use an implementation of the Publisher/Subscriber model. Make sure to set corresponding
	Publisher implementation specific properties</description>

</property>

<property>
  <name>http.redirect.max</name>
  <value>0</value>
  <description>The maximum number of redirects the fetcher will follow when
  trying to fetch a page. If set to negative or 0, fetcher won't immediately
  follow redirected URLs, instead it will record them for later fetching.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>http.redirect.max.exceeded.skip</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>
    Whether to skip the last URL in a redirect chain when when redirects
    are followed (http.redirect.max > 0) and the maximum number of redirects
    in a chain is exceeded (redirect_count > http.redirect.max).
    If not skipped the redirect target URLs are stored as `linked`
    and fetched in one of the following cycles. See also NUTCH-2748.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.redirect.dedupcache.seconds</name>
  <value>-1</value>
  <description>
    The maximum time in seconds fetcher will cache redirects for
    deduplication.  If the same redirect URL is seen again withing
    this time it is skipped. This allows to avoid pathological cases
    where many or most of the URLs of a host are redirected to the
    same URL, eg. a page to login, accept cookies, indicating an
    error.  A value less or equal zero disables redirect deduplication.
    Caveat: This may break setting cookies via recursive redirect chains.
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>fetcher.redirect.dedupcache.size</name>
  <value>1000</value>

<!-- AnchorIndexing filter plugin properties -->

<property>
  <name>anchorIndexingFilter.deduplicate</name>
  <value>false</value>
  <description>With this enabled the indexer will case-insensitive deduplicate anchors
  before indexing. This prevents possible hundreds or thousands of identical anchors for
  a given page to be indexed but will affect the search scoring (i.e. tf=1.0f).

<!-- indexingfilter plugin properties -->

<property>
  <name>indexingfilter.order</name>
  <value></value>
  <description>The order by which index filters are applied.
  If empty, all available index filters (as dictated by properties
  plugin-includes and plugin-excludes above) are loaded and applied in system
  defined order. If not empty, only named filters are loaded and applied
  in given order. For example, if this property has value:
  org.apache.nutch.indexer.basic.BasicIndexingFilter org.apache.nutch.indexer.more.MoreIndexingFilter
  then BasicIndexingFilter is applied first, and MoreIndexingFilter second.
  
  Filter ordering might have impact on result if one filter depends on output of
  another filter.
