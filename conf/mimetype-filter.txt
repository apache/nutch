# config file for mimetype-filter plugin

# This plugin can be configured to work in one of two modes (similar to
# suffix-urlfilter)

# default to reject ('-'): in this mode, all documents will be rejected except
# for those specified in this configuration file.

# default to accept ('+'): in this mode, all documents will be accepted except
# for those specified in this configuration file.

# The format of this config file is one mimetype per line, with no preceding
# whitespace. Order, in which suffixes are specified, doesn't matter. Blank
# lines and comments (#) are allowed.

# block everything
-

# allow only documents with a text/html mimetype
