		A hbase table named 'document' with column family 'f' is expected to exist. If not, below command from hbase shell will create the table

		create 'document', {NAME => 'f', BLOOMFILTER => 'ROW', VERSIONS => '1', IN_MEMORY => 'false', KEEP_DELETED_CELLS => 'FALSE', DATA_BLOCK_ENCODING => 'NONE', TTL => org.apache.hadoop.hbase.HConstants::FOREVER, COMPRESSION => 'NONE', MIN_VERSIONS => '0', BLOCKCACHE => 'true', BLOCKSIZE => '65536', REPLICATION_SCOPE => '0'}

		By default, the expected table name is 'document' with only one column family 'f'. Table with multple column-families can be used.

	<!-- Simple mapping of fields created by Nutch IndexingFilters
	     to fields defined (and expected) in Hbase table.

         Any fields in NutchDocument that match a name defined
         in field/@source will be renamed to the corresponding
         field/@dest. Additionally, column family and qualifier
         can be defined optionally.

         If no field/@family is defined or empty, "f" will be used
         If no field/@qualifier is defined or empty, field/@dest will be used
         Same rules applied for fields which are not defined below

         To add other values in field/@family, the table must have the family present in schema
